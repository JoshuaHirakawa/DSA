/// 274. H-Index
// > Medium
/* 
Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

Example 1:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
Example 2:

Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1

*/

// input: array of nums(citations)
// array length = number of papers
//if we iterate through a sorted array, we can return h-index when number of papers is no longer less than citations

var hIndex = function (citations) {
  // sort citations in decending order
  citations.sort((a, b) => b - a);

  //iterate through sorted array of citations
  for (let i = 0; i < citations.length; i++) {
    // if number of citations is less than the current paper number, return the current index(representing the paper number from prev)
    if (citations[i] < i + 1) return i;
  }
  // when all papers have enough citations for # of papers, return length
  return citataions.length;
};
console.log(hIndex([6, 5, 3, 1, 6, 3]));
